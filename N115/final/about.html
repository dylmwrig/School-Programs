<p>Hello!  My name is Dylan Wright and I am an aspiring game developer with a definite interest in programming.  I plan to pursue a major in Computer Science at Indiana University-Purdue University Indiana with a minor in math, in addition to learning Japanese.</p>
<p>While I hope to someday specialize in game creation, I plan to pick up many things along the way.  Currently I am familiar with C++, Python, some web development and design, and am constantly trying to improve myself artistically.
</p>
<p>I am always looking out for exciting new projects to work on! If you hire me for your work I will bring an insatiable eagerness to learn and a history of working well on teams.
